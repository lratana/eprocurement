# EProcurement - Simple Procurement System

A beginner-friendly Node.js web application for learning web development.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Download from: https://nodejs.org
- Check if installed: Open PowerShell and type `node --version`

### Step 2: Start the application
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Open your web browser
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
- You should see the welcome page!

## 📱 What you can do

- **Homepage**: `http://localhost:3000` - See the main page
- **About Page**: `http://localhost:3000/about` - Learn about the system
- **API**: `http://localhost:3000/api/hello` - Get JSON data

## 🛠️ How it works

The code is very simple and easy to understand:

1. **index.js** - This is the main file that:
   - Imports Express (web framework)
   - Creates a web server
   - Defines what happens when someone visits different pages
   - Starts listening for visitors on port 3000

2. **package.json** - This tells Node.js:
   - What your project is called
   - What dependencies (libraries) you need
   - How to start your application

## 🔧 Making changes

- Edit `index.js` to add new pages or change existing ones
- Save the file and restart with `npm start`
- Refresh your browser to see changes

## 💡 Next steps for learning

1. Try adding a new page (copy the pattern from existing routes)
2. Change the HTML content in the responses
3. Add CSS styling to make it look better
4. Learn about databases to store data

Happy coding! 🎉
